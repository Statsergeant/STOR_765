# Behavioral Health 911 Call Notes(Draft)

## Instruction

In real-life situations, people call 911 for various reasons, including
accidents, violence, or fire emergencies. For our analysis, we will
specifically focus on the call type ‘Behavioral Health,’ which can be
categorized into ‘Mental Health Crisis,’ ‘Suicidal Threats or Attempts,’
or ‘Emotional Distress.’ The objective is to understand the
characteristics of calls falling under this category.

Firstly, we will concentrate on the distribution of ‘Behavioral Health’
calls over time, considering factors such as hours, months, and
weekdays. This will provide insights into when these calls are more
likely to occur.

Secondly, employing spatial analysis, we aim to unveil patterns, trends,
and relationships that may not be immediately apparent. This analysis
will help in understanding the geographical aspects of ‘Behavioral
Health’ calls, offering a comprehensive view beyond temporal
considerations.
